# HilbertMovie

Creates pseudo-Hilbert matrix of indices, such that tracing along the indices would create a hilbert curve.

In addition, it can convert a N-by-N image matrix (N = 2^M, where M is a nonnegative integer) into a vector which lists the values of the matrix along the curve.

This functionality is extended also to a collection of multiple such images, so that a gif file can be condensed into a matrix.
